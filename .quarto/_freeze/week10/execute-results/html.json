R: A language and environment for statistical\n  computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\n  URL https://www.R-project.org/.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = {{R Core Team}},\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2022},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\n\nWe have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it\nwhen using it for data analysis. See also 'citation(\"pkgname\")' for\nciting R packages.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou should also cite the main packages you've used. For example:\n\n> Data wrangling was carried out with `dplyr` [@R-dplyr] and other packages from the `tidyverse` [@tidyverse]; graphs were plotted using `ggplot2` [@R-ggplot2].\n\nAgain, you can use `citation` to generate the correct references. For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitation('dplyr')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nTo cite package 'dplyr' in publications use:\n\n  Wickham H, François R, Henry L, Müller K, Vaughan D (2023). _dplyr: A\n  Grammar of Data Manipulation_. R package version 1.1.3,\n  <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr>.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation},\n    author = {Hadley Wickham and Romain François and Lionel Henry and Kirill Müller and Davis Vaughan},\n    year = {2023},\n    note = {R package version 1.1.3},\n    url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr},\n  }\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you are wondering, `BibTeX` is a file format (and software) used to describe lists of references, often for use within LaTeX documents. The `rmarkdown` package [@rmarkdown2018] provides methods to work with BibTeX references.\n\n### What to cite?\n\nYou should always cite R itself, but there is an element of judgement in deciding which individual packages to cite. For this module, you won't lose marks as long as you have made a reasonable effort.\n\nTo make your work fully reproducible it is best practice to list all the packages you've used (e.g. in an appendix). You can generate the necessary information with the function `sessionInfo()`, but this is not necessary for FDS coursework.\n\n\n",
