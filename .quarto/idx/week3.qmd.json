Group and summarise data in a tabular data set\n2. Use `table()` and functions from the `janitor` package to create cross-tab summaries\n3. Use functions from the `forcats` package to work with factors\n\nYou'll need to use the references and the R help system to develop the above skills as you work through the Week 3 task.\n\n## Reading\n\nR for Data Science [@wickhamR4DS]:\n\n  - Chapter 3 _Data visualisation_\n  - Chapter 5 _Data transformation_\n  - Chapter 6 _Workflow: scripts_\n  - Chapter 7 _Exploratory Data Analysis_\n  - Chapter 8 _Workflow: projects_\n\nR Programming for Data Science [@pengRP4DS]:\n\n  - Chapter 12 _Managing Data Frames with the dplyr package_\n\n## Making slides in R Markdown\n\nYou'll need to make slides for the final assessment - so here's a preview. It's very easy - you can do it straight from the menu: \n\n__File > New File > R Markdown...__\n\nSee the [guide to producing slides](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-11.html) (part of a larger introduction to using R Markdown from the makers of RStudio.)\n\n## Debugging\n\n> Code almost never works properly the first time you write it\n\n> Running into bugs and errors is frustrating, but it's also an opportunity to learn a bit more.\n\n> Errors can be obscure, but they are usually not malicious or random. \n\n> If something has gone wrong, \n> you can find out why it happened.\n\n## Knitting to HTML (hints)\n\n1. make sure all your packages are up to date.\n\n2. does all your .RMD code run properly (i.e. if you click \"run all\" does it run without any error messages) - if it doesn't, fix it.\n\n3. if (2) works, start a new R session on the server (for example, by closing down and restarting) - does the RMD code still run? If not, fix it.\n\n4. once the RMD file runs, try clicking on knit to HTML, again, if that fails and you can't fix it, ask for help.\n  \n5. If you can knit to HTMl, you can try knitting to Word and PDF.\n\n6. If you can knit to Word, you can create a PDF file by exporting from Word\n\n7. If you can't create a PDF file in any other way you can try this as a last resort. If knitting to HTML works and opens an HTML file in a viewer window, click on \"view in browser\". If you are using Chrome, you will be able to save as a PDF document under \"print\".  I advise installing Chrome for UoL work because that is the standard on University machines so most things are tested on it. \n\n## Week 3 Task\n\nSome bigger files to work on this week, and some wider research required.\n\nThe task is on Blackboard and on the server at\n\n`/data/FDS/Scripts/`\n\n`/data/FDS/Data/`\n\n## Check your understanding{.unnumbered}\n  \n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## What is a \"vignette\" in the world of R?\n\nA vignette is a readble introduction to a package, or a particular aspect of it. It is typically more friendly than the bare package documentation (such as the reference PDF file found on CRAN) and contains code examples in a tutorial style.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Find the vignette called _Introduction to dplyr_ and study it.\n\nHere's the link to [Introduction to dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html).\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"week3.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","number-depth":2,"bibliography":["Z2-book.bib","Z3-packages.bib"],"biblio-style":"apalike","link-citations":"yes","description":"These are the course notes for the 2023 version of Fundamentals of Data Science </br>(MA7419 / MA3419)","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"week3.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"number-depth":2,"bibliography":["Z2-book.bib","Z3-packages.bib"],"biblio-style":"apalike","link-citations":"yes","description":"These are the course notes for the 2023 version of Fundamentals of Data Science </br>(MA7419 / MA3419)","documentclass":"scrreprt","papersize":"A4"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
