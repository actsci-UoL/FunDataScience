{"title":"Final reports","markdown":{"headingText":"Final reports","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n## Overview\n\nIn Week 10 you will be submitting your final reports.\n\n## Citing R and packages\n\nThe underlying programme is clearly a massive piece of work and you should give its authors credit by citing them in any work you do using R.\n\nFor example you might write:\n\n> Statistical analysis was done using R 4.1.1 [@R-base].\n\nR makes it easy to generate the right reference to use because there's a built-in function to do it.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: w10_cite\ncitation()\n```\n\nYou should also cite the main packages you've used. For example:\n\n> Data wrangling was carried out with `dplyr` [@R-dplyr] and other packages from the `tidyverse` [@tidyverse]; graphs were plotted using `ggplot2` [@R-ggplot2].\n\nAgain, you can use `citation` to generate the correct references. For example:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: w10_cite2\ncitation('dplyr')\n```\n\nIf you are wondering, `BibTeX` is a file format (and software) used to describe lists of references, often for use within LaTeX documents. The `rmarkdown` package [@rmarkdown2018] provides methods to work with BibTeX references.\n\n### What to cite?\n\nYou should always cite R itself, but there is an element of judgement in deciding which individual packages to cite. For this module, you won't lose marks as long as you have made a reasonable effort.\n\nTo make your work fully reproducible it is best practice to list all the packages you've used (e.g. in an appendix). You can generate the necessary information with the function `sessionInfo()`, but this is not necessary for FDS coursework.\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"week10.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","number-depth":2,"bibliography":["Z2-book.bib","Z3-packages.bib"],"biblio-style":"apalike","link-citations":"yes","description":"These are the course notes for the 2023 version of Fundamentals of Data Science </br>(MA7419 / MA3419)","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"week10.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"number-depth":2,"bibliography":["Z2-book.bib","Z3-packages.bib"],"biblio-style":"apalike","link-citations":"yes","description":"These are the course notes for the 2023 version of Fundamentals of Data Science </br>(MA7419 / MA3419)","documentclass":"scrreprt","papersize":"A4"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
