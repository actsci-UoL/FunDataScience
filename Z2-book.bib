    abstract     = "{AFINN} is a list of English words rated for valence with an integer
between minus five (negative) and plus five (positive). The words have
been manually labeled by Finn {\AA}rup Nielsen in 2009-2011. The file
is tab-separated. There are two versions:

 {AFINN-}111: Newest version with 2477 words and phrases.

 {AFINN-}96: 1468 unique words and phrases on 1480 lines. Note that there
are 1480 lines, as some words are listed twice. The word list in not
entirely in alphabetic ordering.  

An evaluation of the word list is available in:
